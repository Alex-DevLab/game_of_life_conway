// ================ Game of Life Rules ==========================
//      For a space that is populated:
// Each cell with 1 or 0 neighbors dies, as if by solitude.
// Each cell with >= 4 neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
// Each cell with 2 or 3 neighbors survives.
//
//      For a space that is empty or unpopulated:
// Each cell with three neighbors becomes populated.
